# The base config is specially treated. It gets included the other environments automatically.
# Yaml also directly supports merging with & and <<* syntax but doing it automatically
# for a cleaner syntax.
base:
  # If s3_folder is set then the generated templates and app/scripts will automatically
  # be uploaded to s3.
  # There are 2 formats for s3_folder:
  # Format 1:
  # s3_folder: mybucket/path/to/folder # simple string
  # Format 2:
  # s3_folder: # Hash options in order to support different AWS_PROFILEs
  #   default: mybucket/folder
  #   aws_profile1: mybucket/folder
  #   aws_profile2: another-bucket/storage/folder
  # stack_name_suffix: random # tack on a 3 char random string at the end of the stack name
    # for lono cfn create

development:
  # cluster: dev
  # When you have AWS_PROFILE set to one of these values, ufo will switch to the desired
  # environment. This prevents you from switching AWS_PROFILE, forgetting to
  # also switch UFO_ENV, and accidentally deploying to production vs development.
  # aws_profiles:
  #   - dev_profile1
  #   - dev_profile2

production:
  # cluster: prod
  # aws_profiles:
  #   - prod_profile
