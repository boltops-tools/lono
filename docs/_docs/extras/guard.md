You can generate the CloudFormation templates by running:

```sh
$ lono generate
$ lono g -c # shortcut
```

The `lono init` command also sets up [guard-lono](https://github.com/tongueroo/guard-lono).  Guard-lono continuously generates the CloudFormation templates.  Just run guard.

```sh
$ guard
```
