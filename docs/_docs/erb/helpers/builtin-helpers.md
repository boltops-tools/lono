Lono provides a few built-in helper methods that help with template processing.  These methods are available in your template views - the files in the `templates` folder.  Here's a list of the common helper methods:

Helper  | Description
------------- | -------------
extract_scripts | Generates a script that can be included in user_data scripts to extract `app/script` files. More info about the helper is in the [App Scripts docs]({% link _docs/erb/app-scripts.md %}).
file_s3_key(name)  | Helper method that references the s3 key of the file uploaded in app/files.
indent(text, amount) | This is a helper method indents the provided string by a specified number of spaces.
partial(name, variables, options) | Can be used to embed other files in a template.  The partial view should be placed in the `templates/partial` folder of the project.
partial_exist?(name) | Checks whether a partial name exists. This can be helpful for writing custom helpers, covered in [Custom Helpers]({% link _docs/erb/helpers/custom-helpers.md %})
template_params(name) | This returns an Array of the parameter values. This is useful in a parent template if you are using nested templates.  You can use this to grab the `params` values and specify the parameters within the parent template.
template_s3_path(name) | This is the s3 path where template gets uploaded to s3 if s3_folder is set in settings.yml.
user_data(path, vars, options)  | Helper method includes files in the `app/user_data` folder.

The full list of helper methods is available here: [lib/lono/template/helper.rb](https://github.com/tongueroo/lono/blob/master/lib/lono/template/helper.rb).

## Partial examples

The partial template helper is useful and is covered a little more detail here:

* `partial('launch_config')` - Uses the partial in `templates/partial/launch_config`.
* `partial('launch_config', foo: "bar", hello: "world")` - Variables can be passed to the partial helper method are available to the partial as instance variables.  So, in this case `@foo` and `@hello` will be available in the `launch_config` partial.
* `partial('user_data/bootstrap.sh', {}, indent: 10)` - Indent the result partial by 10 spaces.  Useful for yaml format.

Next, we'll cover how you add custom helpers.
