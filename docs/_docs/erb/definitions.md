Template definitions are a core component of lono.  Template definitions are:

1. where you specify the template source to use
2. what variables to make available for those specific templates
3. where the output template files should be written to

A template configuration takes the following general form:

```ruby
template "[OUTPUT NAME]" do
  source "[SOURCE_NAME]"
  variables(
    [HASH_MAP]
  )
end
```

Template definitions are defined in the `app/definitions` folder of your project.

## Examples

Let's walk through an example. Given:

`app/definitions/base.rb`:

```ruby
template "example-stack" do
  source "example"
  variables(
    app: "example-app",
    InstanceType: "m4.small",
    elb: true,
  )
end
```

`templates/example.yml`:

```yaml
Description: <%= @app.capitalize %> Stack
Parameters:
  InstanceType:
    ConstraintDescription: must be a valid EC2 instance type.
    Default: <%= @instance_type %>
    Description: WebServer EC2 instance type
Resources:
...
<% if @elb %>
  elb:
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZones: !GetAZs ""
...
    Type: AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer
<% end %>
```

Note that some of the source code is truncated to keep the explanation concise.  In this example, the source is set as `example`. This tells lono to use the template source found at `source/example.yml`.  The `.yml` extension is inferred automatically.

The variables to use are: `app`, `instance_type` and `elb`.  These variables will be available to the `source/example.yml` template. These variables are only available specifically to the template source, whereas [shared variables]({% link _docs/configs/shared-variables.md %}) are available globally to all templates.

Lastly, the output name specified is `example-stack`.  This tells lono to generate the output template to `output/example-stack.yml`.  The `.yml` extension is inferred automatically.

When [lono generate](/reference/lono-generate/) runs, lono uses the information in `app/definitions/base.rb` and `app/templates/example.yml` to generate the template to `output/templates/example.yml`.

Template definitions also support layering, covered in [Layering Support]({% link _docs/core/layering.md %}).

## Template conventions

The template declaration follows a naming convention that can be used to shorten your template declarations.  Let's say that the template's output name matches the source name:

`app/definitions/base.rb`:

```ruby
template "example" do
  source "example"
  variables(
    app: "example-app",
    InstanceType: "m4.small",
    elb: true,
  )
end
```

Since the output and source name are both `example` you can remove the source line and simplify this declaration down to:

```ruby
template "example" do
  variables(
    app: "example-app",
    InstanceType: "m4.small",
    elb: true,
  )
end
```

If you do not need to declare any variables within the template block, you can take the code down further.

```ruby
template "example" do
end
```

At this point the `do...end` block is optional so then the template declaration becomes one line:

```ruby
template "example"
```

You might think that you will always need to specify template variables in the code block, but it is not always necessary depending on how you use [shared variables]({% link _docs/configs/shared-variables.md %}) which are covered next.
