## Materialized Configsets
{% endif %}

Usually, you add a configset to your Gemfile to make it available for use. Sometimes configsets are not specified by you though. Instead they are inferred by a blueprint or dependency of another configset.  These types of configsets are automatically downloaded. These are known as "materialized" configsets.
