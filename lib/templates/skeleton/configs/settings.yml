  # There are 2 formats for s3_folder:
  # Format 1:
  # s3_folder: mybucket/path/to/folder # simple string
  # Format 2:
  # s3_folder: # Hash options in order to support multiple AWS_PROFILEs
  #   default: mybucket/path
  #   aws_profile1: mybucket/path
  #   aws_profile2: another-bucket/storage/path
