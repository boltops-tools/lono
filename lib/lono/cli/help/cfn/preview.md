## Examples

We'll make a change to the default InstanceType of a CloudFromation stack.

    lono cfn plan demo

The output should look similiar to this:

    Building CloudFormation source code diff...
    => colordiff /tmp/existing_cfn_template.yml output/templates/ec2.yml
    14c14
    <     Default: t2.small
    ---
    >     Default: t2.micro
    Building CloudFormation Change Set for plan.....
    CloudFormation plan for 'ec2' stack update. Changes:
    Modify AWS::EC2::Instance: EC2Instance i-07e939db65120fb75

The plan includes colors:

There are several types of "diffs" in the plan.

1. Source code diff of the templates. This is generated by downloading the current CloudFormation template and comparing it with the locally generated one using `colordiff`.
2. Param diff.
3. CloudFormation Change Set list of changes. This is generated using [AWS CloudFormation Change Set](https://medium.com/boltops/a-simple-introduction-to-cloudformation-part-4-change-sets-dry-run-mode-c14e41dfeab7) feature.
