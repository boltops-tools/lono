<!--
Hi! Thanks for considering to file a feature request with Lono. Please take the time to answer the basic questions. Please try to be as detailed as possible.

Thanks!
-->

## Summary

<!--
A one-paragraph explanation of the feature.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
Why do you want to see this feature in Lono? What use cases does it support?

How the feature would be relevant to 80% or more of Lono users.
-->

## Guide-level explanation

<!--
Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the project and you were teaching it to another programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or upgrade guidance.

If this is a small feature, you may omit this section.
-->

## Reference-level explanation

<!--
This is the technical portion of the feature request. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

If you do not know how to answer this, you can omit it. No worries!
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should we *not* do this?
-->

## Unresolved Questions

<!--
What related issues do you consider out of scope for this feature that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this feature?
