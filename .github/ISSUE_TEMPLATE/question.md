The Lono issue tracker IS NOT for usage questions! Please post your question on our dedicated forum at https://community.boltops.com

To be sensitive to everyone's time, we may close issues asking questions without comment. If you repeatedly post questions in the issues tracker, you may be blocked from ever submitting issues to Lono again. Please use your best judgment. 👍

Posting your questions in the Lono community forum benefits others by grouping questions in a dedicated place. Here are some additional options also https://lono.cloud/support/ 😁
